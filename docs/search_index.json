Shreyas Jadhav,Ashutosh Kanitkar,Patrick Stanton,Kevin Womack 2019-12-12 Chapter 1 Introduction As the field of data science continues to rapidly expand its overall relevance and importance in a myriad of diverse domain areas and societal dilemmas, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand who the data scientists of the future are. Where do they come from? What are they interested in? Could they be biased? Do they look like me? In an effort to explore some of these questions, we surveyed the class of students who will be graduating from the Data Science Master’s program at Columbia University in the year 2020 and developed an exploratory and interactive profile, which we present in the following report.

["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Columbia University offers one of the few, most rigorous data science programs on the planet. Every year, an exclusive cohort of undergraduates and professionals from a diverse range of backgrounds (art history, mathematics, computer science, etc.) are offered admission to the Data Science Institute, where they will typically undergo three semesters of formal education before going on to join the workforce or a doctoral program and solve the world’s most pressing problems with data-driven solutions. With this group that was chosen with the utmost selectivity, we didn’t need to go too far to find a quality pool of future data scientists. However, building our survey was no trivial task by any means. In formulating our questionnaire,we developed three categories for our line of questioning in order to achieve the most interesting/useful results. -Who are we? -How are we doing? -Where are we going? The first category deals with establishing exactly whom our cohort is made up of (ex: gender, academic background, prior institution, etc.). These necessary profile questions would allow us to potentially identify larger trends in the data from our bigger-picture questions. The second and third categories involve the aforementioned “bigger-picture” questions, which cover work-life balance, domain areas of interest, and post-graduation intentions. With regard to the survey format, some questions were formatted with a restricted set of answer choices for ease of cleaning; though, others had to remain open-ended. With this in mind, we wondered how would we deal with the likely noise in the data from these questions in particular. How would we parse out useful insights from noise that could come from a number of areas, including spelling/capitalization errors, diversity in answer, and nonsensical/implausible responses? "],
["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Location of Undergraduate Institution 3.2 Binning Academic Background 3.3 We “Bin” Chillin’ 3.4 Accessibility", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data cleaning process for some our visualizations was rather effortless. With respect to building the social network graph, the class roster was hard-coded into a dropdown selection menu for those related questions so that we could totally avoid capitalization and spelling errors with student’s names. This is not to say, however, that our non-opened-ended questions didn’t produce any noise. For example, one survey respondee self-identified as a 99-year-old in the “Who Are We?” section of questioning. Not only was this an outlier, but this was also a nonsensical answer that we knew we could throw out right away. Though, as expected, the bulk of the heavy lifting with regard to data cleaning and transformation came with the open-ended survey response questions. How would we transform or “bin” the raw text of survey answers in some uniform manner so that we could visualize them without compromising the integrity of their meaning? 3.1 Location of Undergraduate Institution Typically when formulating a survey, one of the first questions a surveyor automatically thinks of is that of nationality or ethnicity. However, with the line of questioning that we had in mind, Professor Robbins advised that this could be a slippery slope that may perpetuate certain racial stereotypes/biases. Therefore, we decided to slightly shift our grouping mechanism to students who had or hadn’t previously done their education in the United States. To do this, on the survey we asked participants for the name of the institution where they last studied before coming to Columbia. Then, with the aid of the Google Maps API, we used the raw text entered to scrape the latitude and longitude coordinates of their institution from the web and bipartition students into USA/NON-USA groups. ## Institute latitude longitude Country_Code ## 1: NYU 40.72951 -73.99646 USA ## 2: University of Delhi 28.58425 77.16383 India ## 3: UC Berkeley 37.87190 -122.25854 USA ## 4: University of California, Los Angeles 34.06892 -118.44518 USA ## 5: lehigh university 40.60487 -75.37752 USA ## Is_USA ## 1: USA ## 2: NON-USA ## 3: USA ## 4: USA ## 5: USA 3.2 Binning Academic Background As previously mentioned, Colubmia admits students from an exceptionally wide range of backgrounds. In fact, upon synthesizing all of the majors with the same type, we found that the DSI 2020 cohort represents a whopping 60 unique majors! While we believe that representing this diversity is important, we needed to find a more feasible way for grouping students that didn’t spread our data too thin. Being that Data Science is supremely comprised of principles from Mathematics/Statistics and the Computer-related fields, it made the most sense to us to group students whose background includes these disciplines and to simply bin all the rest together. We found that by sectioning survey participants in this way, each of the three groups had a reasonable number of students. Lastly, with regard to students who listed a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics, Computer Science was always given priority. ## V2 V3 ## 1: Background Back ## 2: data science Computer ## 3: statistics Maths and Stats ## 4: electrical engineering &amp; computer science Computer ## 5: mathematics Maths and Stats ## 6: math Maths and Stats 3.3 We “Bin” Chillin’ When you ask someone for a rating on a scale of 1-10, what’s the real difference between a rating of 1 and a rating of 2? On this notion, it made sense when visualizing the data from the work-life balance question to group the responses in the following way: Ratings of 1, 2, and 3 were binned to the ‘Chill the most’ class. Ratings of 4 and 5 were binned to the ‘Chill more, work less’ class. Ratings of 6 and 7 were binned to the ‘Work more, chill less’ class. Ratings of 8, 9, and 10 were binned to the ‘Work a lot’ class. ## Work Rate Bins ## 1: 1 Chill the most ## 2: 5 Chill more, work less ## 3: 9 Work a lot ## 4: 5 Chill more, work less ## 5: 5 Chill more, work less 3.4 Accessibility When developing the visualizations that you will see in our “Results” section, color schemes were consciously selected that wouldn’t inhibit the dissemination of this report to color vision deficient readers.

["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values From the beginning, when we came to the decision that we wanted to work with survey data, we worried about the potential lack of class participation. It was troubling to recognize that the validity of our results and insights were directly related to how many people we could rally to participate and fill out our Google Form. Fortunately, out of the 174 students that are enrolled in the EDAV course, we were able to recruit 122 unique and usable responses. This is roughly 71 percent of the entire class! With the participation rate this high, we saw no need to abandon our original idea and continued on with the project. While we simply have no survey data on the missing people, this in no way means that the missing classmates don’t play any role in our visualization process. In fact, in the case of the social network graph, even the missing values still contribute to the structure of the graph. Non-participating persons in the graph are simply grey nodes with no outgoing edges. However, these nodes may still have incoming edges and thus still help us understand how students cluster in our cohort. "],
["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Gender 5.2 Academic Background 5.3 Country of Previous Education", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Gender In the following section, we explore the social patterns and interests of our cohort by gender. Through this analysis we hoped to answer a few questions, namely: Are men and women interested in the same industries and research areas? And how does gender influence the way that we congregate and collaborate within the Data Science Institute? Note that survey respondents were given the option to identify as gender non-binary or “prefer not to say”. Because no participant selected these options, we were able to perform our gender analysis from the strict bipartition of male and female. 5.1.1 How are our interests related, if at all, to our gender? 5.1.1.1 Introduction: In our analysis of the aspiring data scientists in our class by gender, we wanted to identify if any differences existed in our professional and academic interests. In our survey, we asked participants to select the industry that they would most like to work in as well as the topic that they would most want to learn more about. Our first heatmap analyzes the relationship between industry preference and gender. The second heatmap explores a similar question about one’s preference in a data science research topic. 5.1.1.2 Analysis 5.1.1.2.1 Gendered Heatmap by Industry: Irregardless of gender, big tech and finance were the industries that garnered the most interest. However, we found that while more women want to get into consulting, more men are interested in joining start-ups. A priori, we also figured that more men would be interested in sports analytics than women, but the results from our survey reflect an equivalence in interest. 5.1.1.2.2 Gendered Heatmap by Research Topics: Overall, we notice that the interest in various data science topics is uniformly distributed except in the case of Machine Learning and Data Analytics. We notice that Machine Learning is favored more by men while Data Analytics is favored more by women. This higher proportion for Data Analytics in surveyed women may be related to their higher interest in consulting (see previous heatmap). 5.1.2 How does gender influence the way we socialize? 5.1.2.1 Introduction: Data Science, like many other STEM fields, is overwhelmingly male. This begs the question: Is data science becoming an all-boys club? We asked survey participants to select at most five people with whom they interact the most within our Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization class. Using this data, we were able to explore patterns in the social interactions among our classmates. 5.1.2.2 Analysis 5.1.2.2.1 How often do we pick friends of the same gender? This horizontal stacked bar chart shows that men and women more often listed people of their same gender when reflecting on their social circle. In a perfect world, these bars would be split directly down the middle. However, according to our data, intragender connections represent 87% of relationships for both men and women. 5.1.2.2.2 Social Network Graph The following applet is an interactive visualization of the social connections within our Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization class. Each node represents a person within our class. Men are light blue and women are pink. The gray nodes are people who did not fill out the survey. A directed edge from node A to node B represents person A listing person B as social connection in their survey. The nodes that are disconnected from the large network were people who did not list any connections. By moving the cursor over a node, the user can see the country where the person completed their undergraduate education, as well as professional and academic interests. In addition, the user is able to drag nodes to get a better sense of the network structure. Be patient! The network takes some time to load. 5.2 Academic Background 5.2.1 How are our interests related, if at all, to our academic background? 5.2.1.1 Introduction: In this section, we explore the same question as in this last section; however, this time we look at the responses from the lense of academic background. Do students of a particular background tend to have similar interests with respect to industry and research interests? 5.2.1.2 Analysis: 5.2.1.2.1 How does academic background affect our choice of industry? Across academic backgrounds, big tech firms reign supreme as the most popular industry for post-graduation. Perhaps, a majority of theses students chose to pursue a Master’s degree at Columbia so that they could break into the tech industry. Curiously, survey participants with a Mathematics/Statistics background appear to have a higher affinity for the opportunities in the financial sector. Additionally, of those who responded, only people with a history in a computer-related fields reported an interest in healthcare opportunities. 5.2.1.2.2 How does academic background affect our choice of research topics? As previously mentioned, the field of data science is primarily comprised of principles from computing fields and mathematics/statistics. With this in mind, it comes as no surprise that the greater population from these majors prefers to study topics in Machine Learning. While, when we observe the responses from those whose academic background is outside of these areas, the research topic with the most draw is Natural Language Processing. NLP has broad applications in many fields outside of tech, including policy, education, and linguistics. Therefore, maybe students coming from other disciplines simply want to learn data science principles so that they can return to their original field and apply data-centric techniques. 5.3 Country of Previous Education 5.3.1 How does the location of one’s previous study affect how they are dealing with the pressures of attending graduate school in NYC? 5.3.1.1 Introduction: Adjusting to life in New York City can be difficult for anyone. But imagine having to make that adjustment while matriculating through a graduate-level curriculum at an Ivy League institution! Wanting to study attitudes within our cohort, we included a couple of likert questions in our survey in order to gauge how well students were adjusting. How do students who have previously studied in the United States fair alongside their international peers with regard to life in the city and maintaining a healthy work-life balance? 5.3.1.1.1 Background breakdown by prior institution location: To provide some background information and frame the discussion and analysis in this section, the stacked bar chart above visualizes the breakdown of academic background of the surveyed DSI students, grouped by the location of their prior institution. Notice that a greater proportion of students with a Mathematics/Statistics background came from an institution in the United States. In surveyed students who came from an international university, we observed a greater proportion of respondents with a computing background. 5.3.1.2 Analysis 5.3.1.2.1 I love New York City: A priori, we would have expected American students, being native to the country, to have a higher affinity for life in the city. However, our data shows that the opposite is actually the case. Responses from students who studied internationally were reasonably skewed to “Strongly Agree” with absolutely no students in the group answering “Strongly Disagree”. 5.3.1.2.2 Chill Mosaic: We found overall that students who have done their previous education in the US are “chillin’” somewhat more than students coming from overseas. Why would this be? Perhaps, domestic students are more accustomed to the culture of American institutions. Another possible explanation for this disparity could be that credit-hour and work-study requirements are stricter for students with previous degress from international universities. "],

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In order to understand where we’re going, it’s best to first understand who we are. Overall, though admittedly not a shocking discovery, we learned that data scientists are human. We have preferences, likes, and dislikes and they show themselves in the topics we choose to study and in the people who we surround ourselves with. We found that these preferences can be informed by our gender, academic background, and even by the country where we studied before we came to Columbia. But what implications does this have for the future of the field of Data Science? In writing this report, we simply want to remind our readers that (data) scientists are human. And we know that humans carry biases. Therefore, the need for formal policy development and critical bias evaluation in our algorithms should be just as important as efficiency and scalability. Additionally, data scientists should make a conscious effort to check our own prejudices and come to know the people that our work impacts. Simply taking these steps could make all the difference in the long-run. "]
